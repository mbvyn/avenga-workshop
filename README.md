# Avenga Big Data Workshop
Welcome to the Big Data Workshop repository! 

This repository contains code examples and presentation materials 

for a workshop on big data processing using popular tools and technologies.

# Workshop Overview
The workshop is designed to introduce participants to the basics of big data processing, 
including concepts like distributed computing, data storage and retrieval, and data processing frameworks. 

We will explore popular tools and technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka, 
and demonstrate how these can be used to build scalable and fault-tolerant data processing pipelines.

# Getting Started
To get started with the workshop materials, clone this repository to your local machine using Git. 
````  
   git clone https://github.com/mbvyn/avenga-workshop.git
````
You can then explore the code examples and presentation materials in the corresponding directories. 

The code examples are organized by framework, so choose the ones that are most relevant to your needs.

To run docker file simply run command
````
   docker compose up
````
To run bash command in container
````
   docker exec -it <container_name> bash
````

To run spark job in the cluster simply run the command
````
   spark-submit --master <spark-master> <spark-file>
````
